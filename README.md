## Entropy
The idea of this game is to create a 3rd person Open World RPG in Unity 3D.

### Map Inspiration 

All credits go to https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/oblivion for map design and https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Brush_of_Truepaint for image source

The purpose of creating a map without massive graphical quality is that it does not require a lot of artistic skills, as this can take a lot of effort to design. This map inspiration is driven by the fact it still looks very aesthetically appealing even though it is not of high graphic quality.
