# Alex Cherry Final Year Project
My 4th Year Project for Software Development in GMIT.

## Entropy
The idea of this game is to create a 3rd person Open World RPG in Unity 3D. The game is split into Singleplayer and Multiplayer. The player will load into the Singleplayer scene at first. They can pause the game and choose a mission from here which is done in Multiplayer.

### Map Inspiration 

All credits go to https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/oblivion for map design and https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Brush_of_Truepaint for image source

The purpose of creating a map without massive graphical quality is that it does not require a lot of artistic skills, as this can take a lot of effort to design. This map inspiration is driven by the fact it still looks very aesthetically appealing even though it is not of high graphic quality.

### Multiplayer 

Will create a server with Unity. Testing purposes will be done on same computer with two Unity clients at first. 

### AI Partner System

A simple AI is developed to follow the player around and help kill the enemies the player is fighting.
