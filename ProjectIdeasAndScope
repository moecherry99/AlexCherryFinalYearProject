Project Idea / Brainstorm : November 1st. Open world 3D Unity. Changed from FPS.

Researching : 10th November onwards. Which Platforms need to be used, what type of game (FPS/Platformer etc, 3D/2D), what needs to be done first.

Design aspects : Beginning Design 25th November. (Skeleton created 14th November).

Scene Creation for Game : Paint world like in Oblivion (reference this) for less graphic details.

Multiplayer : Mission select on pause screen.

Leaderboards : Most damage done per mission?

Develop an AI that can be a partner to the player. This can be applied to matchmaking for the online system in case the game doesn't get filled (3 players, only 2 join, fill with 1).

Skill System : Cooldowns, make an interface.

Interface : Compass up top, as seen in design document.

Singleplayer : Open world, develop quests from a select amount of NPCs. (3-5).

Aesthetics are not very important, functionality is key. Make a basic scene with proper players and work on functionality straight away.
