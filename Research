Co-op missions -> Instead of implementing the whole world into co-op, there will be a mission section on the 
pause screen to select a mission they choose to do and it will go into matchmaking. You may choose to start 
the mission alone if need be.

Scenery -> Paint world, reference to Oblivion, relies less on graphics and the aesthetic appeal is still good.

Quests -> Need to kill specific enemies for quests obtained from NPCs.
